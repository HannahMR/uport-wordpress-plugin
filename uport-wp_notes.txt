The main focus here is connecting WP to the uport mobile app. wp user should be able to login, and access options through the wp interface

"The uPort Wordpress Bridge needs to fulful the following critieria to be considered ready for non-beta testing purposes.

￼ Infrastructure - Passwordless Login using uPort Attestations. -
    ?? here we need to spinup QR code to allow passwordless login to WP using QR code.
    how will we use mobile app to identify to wp? mobile device will scan QR code to login??


    WP login screen generates qr code representing request for credentials
      how do we generate such a qr code?
      qr encode libraries exist
    user scans qr code
    WP requests creds from mobile app
    mobile app sends  accept/reject  to WP auth


  so, something like uport user wants to login
  user goes to login screen
    integrate into WP login screen?
    utilize on page QR code to login??
    have app send data to WP instance?

what is the pututu.uport.space ? looks like a RESTful endpoint


￼ Feature - Authenticated users can save ERC20 smart contracts to either localstorage or Wordpress database.
￼ Decentralized - Use Web3 object to scan smart contracts to check the authenticated identities token balance." ~ uport-wordpress-plugin README.md
